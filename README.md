# Animation-Builder

Context
A picture is worth a thousand words, and moving pictures are worth many more.

Pictures and moving pictures (animations) can be used to succinctly and effectively illustrate many things. For example, a stationary histogram visually depicts the distribution of some data points. A histogram with moving bar heights visually depicts music (e.g. a music equalizer). Animating graphs can be used to show useful trends in data much more effectively than presenting the same reasoning using raw numbers and text (see here for a visualization of the trend of life expectancy with GDP over time using only circles). A fireworks display is simply a bunch of points moving in certain ways. The Towers of Hanoi problem can be illustrated more effectively as an animation solving it, rather than a description of steps of an algorithm. Many algorithms can be similarly visualized in a way that illustrates how they work more succinctly than descriptions or code. Here are some examples of such visualizations:

All of these animations are built using Java Swing framework and awt.
